# Netflix


A Netflix clone created using HTML and CSS is a basic replica of the popular streaming platformâ€™s interface. This project emphasizes a clean, dark-themed design, showcasing a responsive grid layout for movie thumbnails and smooth navigation for users to explore content.

Key Features:
Navigation Bar:

A sleek, fixed top navbar featuring the Netflix logo on the left and navigation links like "Home," "TV Shows," "Movies," and a search bar. User profile and settings icons are displayed on the right.
Styled with CSS flexbox (display: flex, justify-between) and dark colors like background-color: #141414, and color: white.
Hero Section:

A large banner at the top of the page displaying a featured show or movie, with a "Watch Now" button. The background uses a background-image CSS property to display the banner, and a gradient overlay (linear-gradient) for the signature Netflix look.
Movie/Show Grid:

Below the hero section, a carousel or grid layout of movies and TV shows is implemented. Thumbnails are arranged in rows, using CSS grid (grid-template-columns) for a flexible, responsive design. Hover effects (transform: scale(1.1)) give a pop-out effect when users hover over the thumbnails.
Movies are displayed with title overlays and icons like "Play" and "Add to My List," styled with CSS for smooth user interaction.
Footer:

A minimal footer featuring links to help, terms of service, privacy policies, and social media icons. The footer follows the dark theme with white text (color: #999) and is aligned using CSS flexbox or grid.
Design Elements:
Dark Theme: The entire website follows Netflix's signature black and red theme, utilizing background-color: #141414 for the overall background and #e50914 for highlights (like buttons).
Typography: CSS is used to style headers (font-size: 24px, font-weight: bold) and movie titles (text-align: center, color: white), creating a cinematic feel.
Responsiveness: Media queries in CSS ensure the layout adjusts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. On smaller screens, the grid layout becomes a vertical scroll instead of horizontal rows.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure for the Netflix-like layout, including the navbar, movie sections, and footer.
CSS: Handles the visual styling, including grid layouts, flexbox for positioning, hover effects, and responsive behavior.
This Netflix clone demonstrates how to use HTML and CSS to build an engaging, visually appealing interface, similar to the actual streaming service.
